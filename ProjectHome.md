The project aims to develop a user-friendly PVR web interface to download automatically tv series, using transmission, php, python and mysql.
The whole project has been rewritten (before being released) to implement classes, to easily expand its functionalities.

Has been added the support to automatically:
  * Download subtitles (through customizable php scripts, a plugin for addic7ed.com comes out of the box!)
  * Generate files for XBMC
  * Subscribe and download your own shows (show quality is now customizable)

Project is now almost in stable release; very soon an howto video will be added.
For installation, read the README after the svn checkout.
