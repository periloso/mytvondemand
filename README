First, install the required packages:

- On Debian, write the following to a console:
apt-get install python-mysqldb php5-mysql php5-cli apache2 mysql-server python-xml

- On Ubuntu it should be the same, but it hasn't been tested yet.
- On other Linux distributions, look for those packages in your package manager.


Then copy all this directory to the apache public directory.
- Configure MySQL and add a new database (it is recommended to use its own
  user and pass).
  ex. root@vmdl-01:/var/www/# mysql
      mysql> create database mytvod;
      mysql> quit;

- Write the following in a shell to build required tables:
  mysql -u <username> -p <dbname> < mytvod.sql
  ex. mysql -u root < mytvod.sql   # root user, without any password
  ex. mysql -u root -p < mytvod.sql # root user with a password (asked later)

- Need to edit the config.php and update DB connections to your settings 
  (username, password and database name)
  ex. nano config.php

Make sure temp/ and cache/ directories are writable by the web server

- On Debian/Ubuntu you can write 
  chown www-data:www-data -R . && chmod 775 -R cache/ temp/
- On Centos-like you can write 
  chown apache:apache -R . && chmod 775 -R cache/ temp/

Connect to your server's IP.
