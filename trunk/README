First, install the required packages:

- On Debian, write the following to a console:
apt-get install python-mysqldb php5-mysql php5-cli apache2 mysql-server python-xml

- On Ubuntu it should be the same, but it hasn't been tested yet.
- On other Linux distributions, look for those packages in your package manager.


Then copy all this directory to the apache public directory.
Configure MySQL and add a new database (it is recommended to use its own user and pass).

Write the following in a shell to build required tables:
mysql -u <username> -p <dbname> << mytvod.sql

Make sure temp/ and cache/ directories are writable by the web server

- On Debian/Ubuntu you can write `chown www-data:www-data -R . && chmod 775 -R cache/ temp/`
- On Centos-like you can write `chown apache:apache -R . && chmod 775 -R cache/ temp/`

Connect to your server's IP.
